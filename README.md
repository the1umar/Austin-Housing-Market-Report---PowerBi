# Austin-Housing-Market-Report---PowerBi

•	Transformed and cleaned the Austin housing market dataset to prepare it for subsequent analysis.
•	Conducted neighborhood insights for Austin and the surrounding metro area accounting for 45 housing variables.
•	Developed visualizations using Power Query and DAX, enabling clear communication of trends, and advising investors on high-growth areas.

Ultimately this was my first main project handling Power Bi. I took up the software as its implementation is being seen across a variety of companies, and is a very neat tool for Data Visualization :)
